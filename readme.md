# MicroCO2 Sensor
Inspired from https://github.com/nup002/miniCO2
This is a smaller version using a USB-C connector, paired with a tiny CO2 sensor and the new RPI pico chip (RP2354A)

The MicroCO2 is a miniature USB-powered CO2 sensor that can be used 
anywhere you need a simple indicator of CO2. Its built-in LEDs light up green, orange, or red, depending on the 
amount of CO2 in the air. The default levels can be adjusted via software to suit your needs.

## Compatibility
The MiniCO2 works with any standard USB type C port that can supply power. It can therefore be plugged in nearly 
anywhere: Laptops, displays, chargers, battery banks, etc. You can for example plug it into the USB port of a 
airplane seat to monitor the cabin air quality.

## Repo status
The repository is a work in progress. Currently, only the Altium design files are provided

## Licenses
The MicroCO2 hardware is licensed under CERN-OHL-S v2 and originally created by https://github.com/nup002
